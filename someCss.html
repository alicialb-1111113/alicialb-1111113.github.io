<h1 style="font: size 700%;">Summer</h2>
<p style="font-size:180%;">Summer is my favorite season. I love summer because of the beautiful weather we have in Washington State. The gorgeous weather makes many outdoor activites more enjoyable, plus I love to relax in the sun. Lake Crescent is one of my favorite places to be during the warm weather. Hanging out with family and friends barbecuing at the lake cabin is always a blast. We go wakeboarding, tubing, and on beautiful hikes. Another place we love to frequent is the Olympic Hot Springs. During quarentine, I like to meet up with friends at the Spit in Port Angeles where we can either sit in our seperate cars and chat or walk on the beach, with a six feet distance, enjoying the view.</p>
